/**
 *
 * A ConflatingQueue is an unbounded, blocking, data structure that holds item of the type @{@link KeyValue <K, V>}.
 * It can be considered FIFO with respect to its items' keys, but not necessarily its items' values. A ConflatingQueue
 * does not support null items.
 *
 * A ConflatingQueue is thread-safe and supports multiple producers and multiple consumers.  Each item on the queue is made
 * available to at most one single consumer.
 *
 * A ConflatingQueue would typically be used as an interface between a high frequency producer and low frequency consumer,
 * where it is still meaningful to process the most recent value for each key. For example:
 *
 * 		The producer might be a market data feed handler connected to a high frequency cryptocurrency exchange that is
 * 		streaming last traded price updates per symbol.  The consumer might be a trading system that needs to react to the
 * 		latest market data updates per symbol.
 *
 * A typical sequence of events might be:
 *
 * 		1. The consumer calls take(), and blocks as the queue is empty.
 * 		2. The producer calls offer(@{@link KeyValue}) with key = BTCUSD, value = 7000.  The consumer unblocks and receives
 * 		   the @{@link KeyValue}.
 * 		3. The producer calls offer(@{@link KeyValue}) with key = BTCUSD, value = 7001
 * 		4. The producer calls offer(@{@link KeyValue}) with key = ETHUSD, value = 250
 * 		5. The producer calls offer(@{@link KeyValue}) with key = BTCUSD, value = 7002, which replaces the queued price 7001
 * 		6. The consumer calls take() three times.  The consumer first receives key = BTCUSD, value = 7002, then receives
 * 		   key = ETHUSD, value = 250, then blocks as the queue is empty.
 *
 * @param <K> the type of the "key" part of the @{@link KeyValue} that this queue holds
 * @param <V> the type of the "value" part of the @{@link KeyValue} that this queue holds
